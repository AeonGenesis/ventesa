# Adding a Component

When adding a new component, you'll be creating a new directory in `<project-directory>/src/components` or one of it's subdirectories for your new component. Let's say you're going to add a `Banshee` component. In the following examples, trade out the word "Banshee" with whatever your actual component will be called.

## Adding your files

1) First add the directory `<project-directory>/src/components/Banshee/`.  
2) Next add an `index.js` to the directory: `<project-directory>/src/components/Banshee/index.js` with the following:

```
export { default } from './Banshee';
```

3) Next create `Banshee.js`, the file where the actual component will go.

```
import React from 'react';

/**
 * My Banshee component.
 */
function Banshee() {
  return <div>Banshee<div/>;
}

export default Banshee;
```

NOTE: Please keep the comment before the function and fill it out. Not only does this help describe the component to others, but it is used when generating documentation for the component with storybook.

4) You can now pull in your new component by importing the folder!

```
import Banshee from '../Banshee';
```

## Styling your Component

We're currently styling our components using the fantastic [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/docs) library. This allows us to style components directly in our js files while using natural CSS and programmatically change styles based on props.

### Making a styled component

First, import styled-components to the top of your file:

```
import styled from 'styled-components';
```

Then, you can create HTML elements with it:

```
const BansheeSection = styled.section`
  display: flex;
  /* Other CSS */
`;
```

You can use these like any react components!

```
/**
 * My Banshee component.
 */
function Banshee() {
  return <BansheeSection>I'm coming for you!</BansheeSection>;
}
```

### Including values from the theme

To include values from the theme in your CSS pull in the helpers from the theme folder. Here's an example:

```
import { bgColor } from '../../theme';
```

Other helpers can be found at `<project-directory>/src/theme/helpers.js`.

Next, import the `useTheme` function from [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started):

```
import { useTheme } from '@chakra-ui/core';
```

You can now pull the theme into your function and send it into the styled elements:

```
const BansheeSection = styled.section`
  display: flex;
  background-color: ${bgColor('accent')};

  /* Other CSS */
`;

/**
 * My Banshee component.
 */
function Banshee() {
  const theme = useTheme();

  return <BansheeSection theme={theme}>Banshee<BansheeSection/>;
}
```

You can find all the theme values themselves at `<project-directory>/src/theme/theme.js`.

## Adding Props and Validation

When adding a property to a component, we use [PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) to validate at runtime that we got the right set of values of the right types. To add PropTypes validation first import the library:

```
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
```

Then, after your component function is defined, add a `propTypes` property to the function with whatever properties it is supposed to have. Follow [this link](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html#proptypes) for documentation about what validation is available. Please avoid using `any` unless you have a good reason for it. Here's an example of making `Banshee` require a `target`:

```
Banshee.propTypes = {
  target: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
};
```

You can also give a property a default value if you wish. After defining the `propTypes` for a component, you can add a second property of `defaultProps`. Here's an example with `Banshee`:

```
Banshee.defaultProps = {
  target: 'Crucifix Lady',
};
```

Your validation is now setup, so go ahead and destructure the property out of the `props` object sent to your component:

```
function Banshee({ target }) {
  /* component code */
}
```

## Considerations for Other Files

• Every component, unless you have a *very* good reason, should also have a test file: `*.spec.js`. If nothing else, just test that the component renders successfully. Please see the testing documentation on how to do this.  
• Any component that is meant to be reusable should also have a `*.stories.js` file. Please see the Storybook documentation on how to do this.
