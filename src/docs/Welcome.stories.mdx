# Exalted VTT

## Welcome

The purpose of this documentation will to help you go from an empty directory to running the project. This project uses exclusively javascript & HTML5 with generous reliance on other projects. The aim is to make running Exalted 3rd Edition, a fairly complicated game, easy to run. We're attempting to work on both tablets and desktops, but we're assuming that no one is running Exalted on their phone with our app. If they are trying to, please stage a loving intervention for your troubled friend.

The breakpoint widths that we're supporting are as follows:  
• 768px  
• 960px  
• 1280px

The major projects that we are relying on are:  
• **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** - For rendering the UI.  
• **[Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/docs)** - For allowing CSS-in-JS for styling.
• **[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)** - For rendering the UI in an applicatin window instead of the browser.  
• **[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)** - For testing the project.  
• **[React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/)** - To help us unit test the UI as the user would use it.  
• **[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)** - For documentation.  
• **[eslint](https://eslint.org/)** - For linting the project and finding common mistakes automatically. See the linting documentation for more.  
• **[prettier](https://prettier.io/)** - For maintaining code style automatically.  
• **[husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)** - For automatically running eslint/prettier/jest when appropriate (git commit/push).  
• **[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started)** - For some of it's components that we won't have to create ourself. :)  

## Prerequisite software

• Some terminal: You choose.  
• **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)** - Our source control.  
• **[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)** - What we use to build the project, and where you get `npm` from. We're a 12.18 project at the moment.

Optional:  
• [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - If you want to do local testing in electron or in the browser, that is up to you.

That's it, git and node. I do, however, recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) for convenience if you're comfortable with the terminal.

## Project setup

Our project code is hosted on [github here](https://github.com/Riobe/exalted-combat-tracker). To get the code, follow these steps:

1) [Make a github.com account](https://github.com/join) if you do not have one.  
2) [Create an SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to give github if you do not have one you want already.  
3) [Add the SSH key to github](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) so that it will recognize you.  
4) In the terminal, `cd` to the directory you want the code in and run:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:Riobe/exalted-combat-tracker.git
```

This will allow you to see and run the code. If you're looking to be able to make changes, then you'll need to fork the project and submit pull requests.


5) `cd` into the project directory and run the following commands:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

That's it! It should start up and run the project itself in both electron and a browser, and then open a tab with the storybook documentation.
